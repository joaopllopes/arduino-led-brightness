# Arduino Led Brightness
This is a simple example to show how you can control the brightness of a LED based on a Potentiometer.

As far as hardware goes, you will need the following components in order to follow this example:

* 1 x Arduino Board
* 1 x Breadboard
* 5 x Cable (5v)
* 1 x 120^omhs Resistor
* 1 x Potentiometer (5v)
* 1 x LED

The "arduino.jpg" image shows how you how to connect these components to each other.

The "arduino.cpp" contains the source code for the micro controller.
